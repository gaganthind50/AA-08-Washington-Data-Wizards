## Problem Statement
Health ministry officials in countries affected by neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) currently lack a usable solution that aids in making informed decisions regarding efficiency in executing medical delivery programs. 

Currently, decisions on where to start, stop, and restart (if necessary) mass drug administration campaigns are being hindered by an issue that is referred to internally as a “two map problem”, where the latest data of prevalence of disease geographically mismatches the intensity of effort by campaigns to control it. Essentially, data that should be grouped together on a map is being displayed separately on maps, with different layouts and scales. Improving the usability of this portal will allow those less familiar with the data to gain quick insight.

## What to expect here
* Country-by-country dashboards that visualize drug incongruencies
* Executive summary provided with recommendations
* Connection with Institute for Health Metrics data
* Robust documentation of process
* Write-up on our understanding of the current data
